Q  Finally, a COVID vaccine is out on the market and the Chefland government has asked you to form a plan to distribute it to the public as soon as possible. There are a total of NN people with ages a1, a2,_ _ _,an
There is only one hospital where vaccination is done and it is only possible to vaccinate up to DD people per day. Anyone whose age is ≥80 or ≤9 is considered to be at risk. On each day, you may not vaccinate both a person who is at risk and a person who is not at risk. Find the smallest number of days needed to vaccinate everyone.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        int n,d;
        cin>>n>>d;
        int c1=0;
        int c2=0;
        int x,y;
        int a[n];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            cin>>a[i];
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(a[i]>=80||a[i]<=9)
            c1++;
             else
             c2++;
        }
        x=c1/d;
        y=c2/d;
        if(c1%d!=0)
        x++;
        if(c2%d!=0)
        y++;
        cout<<x+y<<endl;
    }
	// your code goes here
	return 0;
}
